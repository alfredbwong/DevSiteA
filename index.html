            <p class="section-content"> Software develop extrodinaire. Hello, my name is Alfred Wong. I recently graduated from McMaster University in the field of Engineering
                and I am out to make a name for myself in the field of software. I personally found my interest in software when I did my first internship 
                back in 2015 in Ottawa for Ericsson Canada Inc working alongisde like-minded individuals and upon graduating started work as a young TCS consultant for
                CIBC as a mobile web application developer. New technologies, analytics, optimization are all facets that get me excited to be working in this industry.
